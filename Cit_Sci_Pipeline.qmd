## Automated QAQC of Third-Party Data

Acknowledging and utilising third-party data enables the Environment Agency to work from a shared evidence base with its partners. Already a member of Catchment Partnerships nationwide, and with Integrated Environmental Planning teams within each EA area, the EA is in a good position to use freely available data collected by its partners to gather intelligence on the state of the environment in England.

A blocker for Citizen Science data is that it often uses off-the-shelf equipment and is collected by citizens which aren't by definition environmental specialists. It can, therefore, carry errors and requires a layer of Quality Assurance and Quality Control.

Below we outline how this process of QAQC can be automated using the Defra Analytics & Science Hub (DASH) platform so that when Citizen Science data arrives at The Agency it undergoes QAQC, enabling this data to be used by analysts within the EA, in a way in which margins of error have been constrained.

#### Potential workflow for Citizen Science Data

The below schematic uses existing EA and Defra systems. You can find out more about the DASH platform on the EA Sharepoint.
